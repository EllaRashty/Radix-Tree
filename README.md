# Radix-Tree
Implementation of Radix Tree.
The program was created for a assignment in data structure course. 
The goal was to implementation data structure that storage all the words from input file and shows where each word appears (which line).
The program should prints all the words sorted by alphabet. 
In the assignment the implementation shouldn't include any data structures that already implementation in the language or in some library. 
The Radix Tree contain nodes when all one of them was initialization with 2 HashMap (one for words and the second for lines).

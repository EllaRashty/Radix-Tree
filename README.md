Implementation of Radix Tree.

This program was created for an assignment in a data structure course.

The goal was to implement a data structure that stores all the words from an input file and shows where each word appears (in which line).

The program should print all the words sorted alphabetically.

The main guideline was not to use any existing data structure of python. I dealt with this restriction by writing my own data structure from scratch. 

The Radix Tree contains nodes, and each one of them was held 2 HashMap (one for words and the second for lines).
